# Data sources

This directory provides information about the different data sources and how we integrate data.
For each data source we provide, among others, a Jupyter notebook with an analysis to provide an overview, detailled information are listed in the README of the respective data source directory.

Additionally, we provide a general Jupyter notebook for the systematic integration of the different data sources (`linking-analysis.ipynb`)

Currently the following data sources are considered

* The Royal Library of Belgium (KBR)
* The Royal Library of the Netherlands (KB)
* The national library of France (BnF)
* A wikidata dump of Belgians including some other identifiers, manually enriched with KBR identifiers
